# Refactor and Documentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on refactoring and documenting a Python script (`undocumented_script.py`) to improve readability, efficiency, and professional code quality.  
The assignment simulates a full development workflow by having me act as both the **developer** and **reviewer**.

## Files
- **undocumented_script.py** — Refactored and documented Python script following PEP 8 and PEP 257 standards.  
- **DECISIONS.md** — Explains the reasoning behind the design choices, variable renaming, and Pythonic improvements.  
- *(Optional)* **README.md** — This file. Provides a quick summary of the project and structure.

## Key Improvements
- Replaced loops with Pythonic list comprehensions  
- Added descriptive variable and function names  
- Added type hints and docstrings for clarity  
- Added light inline comments where helpful  
- Wrote detailed explanations in `DECISIONS.md`  
- Simulated a self-review process via GitHub pull request comments  

## Running the Script
Run the program directly from the terminal:
```bash
python undocumented_script.py
